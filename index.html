                <strong style="font-size: 28px"><u>The Pomeranian</u></strong><br><br>Pomeranian (often known as a Pom) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is named for the Pomerania region in north-west Poland and north-east Germany in Central Europe.
                Pomeranians are small dogs weighing 1.36–3.17 kilograms (3.0–7.0 lb) and standing 8–14 inches (20–36 cm) high at the withers. 
                They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured coat with a highly plumed tail set high and flat. 
                The top coat forms a ruff of fur on the neck, which Poms are well known for, and they also have a fringe of feathery hair on the hindquarters

                <strong style="font-size: 28px"><u>The Golden Retriever</u></strong><br><br>The Golden Retriever is a medium-large gun dog that was bred to retrieve shot waterfowl, such as ducks and upland game birds, during hunting and shooting parties.
                The name "retriever" refers to the breed's ability to retrieve shot game undamaged due to their soft mouth. The coat is generally lighter in colour than in the American types. 
                Males stand between 22 to 24 in (56 to 61 cm) at the withers; females are between 20 to 22 in (51 to 56 cm).  
                Golden retrievers have an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards. 
                They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner coat that provides them with adequate warmth in the outdoors, and an outer coat that lies flat against their bodies and repels water.

                <strong style="font-size: 28px"><u>The Husky</u></strong><br><br>A husky is a sled dog used in the polar regions. 
                One can differentiate huskies from other dog types by their fast pulling-style.
                When used as a sled dog, they represent an ever-changing crossbreed of the fastest dogs(the Alaskan Malamute, by contrast, pulled heavier loads at a slower speed).
                Humans use huskies in sled-dog racing. Huskies are also kept as pets, and groups work to find new pet homes for retired racing and adventure-trekking dogs.
